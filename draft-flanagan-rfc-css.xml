    <abstract>


<t>While individuals may choose their own Cascading Style Sheet for presenting HTML-formatted RFCs, the default offered by the RFC Editor must meet certain requirements.  This draft describes those requirements.</t>

<t>Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The RFC Series has been in existence for over 40 years.  During much of that time, the limitations of character set, line and page lengths, and allowed graphics within RFC documents met the most immediate needs of the majority of authors and readers.  As technology changed, new formats that allowed for a richer set of edit, search, and display features came in to use, and tools were created to convert the plain ASCII documents to other desired formats such as HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word.  While the converted versions of the RFCs are widely available, the canonical display format remains the plain-text, ASCII, line-printer structured one.</t>

<t>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format to XML <xref target="XML-ANNOUNCE"/>.  The high-level requirements for the format of RFCs were defined in "RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development" <xref target="RFC6949"/>.  Several different publication formats will be rendered from that canonical XML, including HTML, PDF, TXT, and EPUB.</t>

<t>As part of that work, the RFC Format Design Team recommended that the HTML publication format focus on semantic HTML, leaving style information in a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).  While the RFC Editor must provide a default CSS, individuals may develop and use their own CSS locally.</t>

<t>This document describes the requirements for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor.</t>
