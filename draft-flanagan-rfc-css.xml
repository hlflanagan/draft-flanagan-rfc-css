    <abstract>


<t>While individuals may choose their own Cascading Style Sheet for presenting
 HTML-formatted RFCs, the default offered by the RFC Editor must meet certain 
requirements.  This draft describes those requirements.</t>

<t>Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The HTML format for RFCs, described in <xref target="I-D.hildebrand-html-rfc"/> assigns style guidance to an RFC Editor-defined Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).  This CSS will be embedded in the published HTML, and may be overridden by a locally defined CSS as desired.  The embedded, default CSS as included by the RFC Editor is expected to take into account accessibility needs and be built along a responsive design model.</t>

<t>This document describes the requirements for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor.  The requirements will only be applied to HTML documents published as per <xref target="I-D.flanagan-rfc-framework"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="design-goals" title="Design Goal">

<t>RFCs must be adaptable to a wide variety of devices and displays, accessible to assisted readers, and printable.</t>
