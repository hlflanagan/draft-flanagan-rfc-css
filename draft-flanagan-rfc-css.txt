                       CSS Requirements for RFCs
                       draft-flanagan-rfc-css-00

Abstract

   While individuals may choose their own Cascading Style Sheet for
   presenting HTML-formatted RFCs, the default offered by the RFC Editor
   must meet certain requirements.  This draft describes those
   requirements.

   Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list
   (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at https://www
   .rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

1.  Introduction

   The RFC Series has been in existence for over 40 years.  During much
   of that time, the limitations of character set, line and page
   lengths, and allowed graphics within RFC documents met the most
   immediate needs of the majority of authors and readers.  As
   technology changed, new formats that allowed for a richer set of
   edit, search, and display features came in to use, and tools were
   created to convert the plain ASCII documents to other desired formats
   such as HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word.  While the converted versions
   of the RFCs are widely available, the canonical display format
   remains the plain-text, ASCII, line-printer structured one.

   In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was
   made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format to XML
   [XML-ANNOUNCE].  The high-level requirements for the format of RFCs
   were defined in "RFC Series Format Requirements and Future
   Development" [RFC6949].  Several different publication formats will
   be rendered from that canonical XML, including HTML, PDF, TXT, and
   EPUB.

   As part of that work, the RFC Format Design Team recommended that the
   HTML publication format focus on semantic HTML, leaving style
   information in a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).  While the RFC Editor
   must provide a default CSS, individuals may develop and use their own
   CSS locally.

Internet-Draft                     I-D                    September 2014


   This document describes the requirements for the default CSS used by
   the RFC Editor.

2.  Design Goals

   Looking for content that is adaptable to a wide variety of devices
   and displays, accessible to assisted readers, and printable.

3.  General Requirements

   o  Support the display of the semantic HTML described in
      [draft-hildebrand-html-rfc].

   o  Follow best practice for accessibility, as defined by the W3C's
      "Best Practices for Authoring HTML" [HTMLBP].

   o  Follow best practice for mobile devices, as defined by the W3C's
      "Best Practices for Authoring HTML."

   o  Allow for a broad range of internationalized scripts.

4.  Page Layout

4.1.  Title Page Header

   The document header must be at the top of the page and include all
   information described in the "Style Guide" and "RFC Streams, Headers,
   and Boilerplates" [draft-iab-styleguide] [RFC5741]

4.2.  Body

   The body of the document must conform to the following:

   o  Examples and code blocks must be in a fixed-width font

   o  ASCII art must be in a fixed-width font

   o  reflow the text as the screen gets smaller and limit max width

   o  Block quotes must be indented

   o  Tables must allow for distinct header rows

   o  Paragraphs should include a hover-over paragraph identifier

4.3.  Font Choices

Internet-Draft                     I-D                    September 2014


   o  default to a font with full Unicode support; must be or include a
      fixed-width font; publicly licensed

5.  Printing

   The CSS must include support for a printer-friendly output.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security vulnerabilities can be introduced through the CSS.  How much
   detail do we need to go into here to say "don't do foolish things and
   introduce security issues?"

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft contains no action for IANA
